## Deviation From Given Specification

I tried to fulfil all the specifications of the project. Some deviations are:

1.  Instead of
    â€‹https://coinmarketcap.com/api/, I have used https://www.coingecko.com/api/
    as I could not find a free version of coinmarketcap.
2.  I could not think of a good way to implement filtering based on price range
    and market cap range. These values lied between very small fractional values
    to very very large values. Representing them on a small slider was difficult
    for me.
3.  Instead of opening **Price Chart View** on clicking anywhere on the row, I designed
    it to work on clicking on the crypto currency name (which I designed to be a link)
4.  Also, instead of making check boxes appear on long press on a row, I designed the
    checkboxes to be always present. Whenever you select:
    a. One or more checkbox, _Mark as favorite_ button appears
    b. Exactly two checkboxes, _Compare_ button appears.
